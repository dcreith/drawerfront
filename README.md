Calculates and draws drawer front heights based on different equations. Useful for comparing layouts to find the most pleasing sizing. Web app can be viewed at https://dcreith.github.io/drawerfront/.

<h2>Calculations</h2>

<h3>Hambridge</h3>
The bottom drawer has a height of [(square root of 2) – 1] times the
drawer width.

The second drawer from the bottom has a height of [(square root of 3) – (square root of 2)] times drawer width.

The nth drawer has a height of [(square root of n+1) – (square root of n)] times drawer width.

<h3>Geometric</h3>

Each drawer height calulated as a percentage of the previous drawer

<h3>Fibonacci/Phi</h3>

Each set of two drawers calculated as 1.618 based on the lower drawer (includes rails)

<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

Each drawer height is reduced by a fixed amount from the lower drawer

<h3>Manual</h3>

Enter each drawer height individually

<h3>Manual/Diff</h3>

Enter the difference between each drawer
